# Moodle unowebconv plugin

This Repository contains the code for the `unowebconv` plugin, an alternative to the unoconv moodle plugin, that uses a webservice for the document conversions.

## How to use

To install this plugin in moodle there are two ways:

1. Install the plugin from zip (recommended)
   _Important:_ only create a zip from the unowebconv folder (e.g. `unowebconv.zip`)

2. Copy the folder `unowebconv` and its contents to `files/converter/` within the moodle installation and run a database upgrade.

After the plugin was installed sucessfully, do not forget to provide a path pointing to the corresponding webservice, after that the plugin is enabled and ready to use.
